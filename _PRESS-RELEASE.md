There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

    Goalkeeper, achieve-ly...not sure yet about name. //FIX ME!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  This app is for those who struggle acheiving large goals in the past, and want an effective and organized way to achieve them.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Achieve your big goals by setting specific, measurable, and achievable small goals with deadlines. Create a goal, and assign smaller tasks and subtasks that will help you achieve that goal. Manage your upcoming deadlines with an easy to use interface, and visualize your progress towards acheiving your larger vision.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Big goals may sound difficult to accomplish, and we often tend to put them off because we don't know where to start or how to get there. Goals cannot be achieved unless they are specific, measurable, and time-dependent. Big goals sound intimidating, and we may think we lack accountability to achieve them.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

   Through visualization, organization, and accountability, we solve the problem of achieving lofty goals that seem unattainable. Goals can be broken down into smaller targeted tasks with achievable deadlines. Through our interface, users can keep track of their progress towards their larger goals.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  //TO DO

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Simply sign up, add a big goal, and begin creating smaller measurable subtasks needed to accomplish your goal. Set timelines for each task. Then start seeing your progress as you check things off! Use our app to prioritize your tasks and visualize them easily.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  //TO DO

  "_____ helped me achieve my goal of losing 50 pounds by allowing me to keep track of my progress while setting smaller more specific targets."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
